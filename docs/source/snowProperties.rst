snowProperties - an interface to snowflake library
==================================================


The snowScatt package provides access to the microphysical and scattering properties of an extensive library of snow particle models. The main component of the snowScatt package is the core snow library and the interface to access it. snowScatt uses the structural properties of aggregates of various types to simulate the microphysical (size, mass, area, aspect ratio) and scattering (absorption, scattering, phase function) properties of realistically shaped snowflakes.
