The `snowScatt <https://github.com/OPTIMICe-team/snowScatt.git>`_ package is a project of the `OPTIMICe <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/research/en-optimice>`_ research group at the Institute of Geophysics and Meteorology of the University of Cologne, Germany `IGMK <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/>`_.
OPTIMICe is funded by the German Science Foundation **DFG** through the `Emmy Noether <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/forschung/en-optimice/what-is-optimice>`_ program.

The OPTIMICe team is lead by `Dr Stefan Kneifel <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/institute/staff/dr-stefan-kneifel>`_ who gave the initial motivation for the development of snowScatt and initiated the application of SSRGA to radar remote sensing. The lead developer of snowScatt is `Dr Davide Ori <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/institute/staff/ori>`_ with the support of `Leonie von Terzi <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/institute/staff/von-terzi>`_  and `Markus Karrer <https://geomet.uni-koeln.de/en/institute/staff/karrer>`_

The snowScatt project wouldn't have been possible without the studies on Self-Similar Rayleigh-Gans of Dr. Robin Hogan, Dr. Chris Westbrook and co-authors [Hogan2017]_ [Hogan2014]_

We also thank Dr. Robin Hogan for making a public reference implementation of the `SSRGA algorithm <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/clouds/ssrga/>`_
